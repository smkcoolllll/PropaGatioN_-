This JavaScript game is a simple bubble-popping game with a timer and score mechanism. Bubbles with random numbers appear on the screen, and the player must click on the bubble containing the currently specified "hit" value. 
For each correct hit, the player's score increases by 10, while an incorrect hit results in a deduction of 10 points. The game continues for a duration of 60 seconds, after which a Game Over screen is displayed, allowing the player to play again. 
The player's goal is to maximize their score within the time limit.
